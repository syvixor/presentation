# What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks typically requiring human cognition. AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Key capabilities of AI include:
- **Learning**: AI can learn from data, improving its performance over time.
- **Reasoning**: AI can make decisions based on rules or by drawing conclusions from large datasets.
- **Perception**: AI can interpret and understand sensory data like images, speech, and text.

AI is transforming the way we interact with technology, making processes smarter and more efficient.
